TALIS EBMS is a plateform that allows you to export invoices from a TALIS System and send them to OBR (Office Burundaise des Recettes). 
As TALIS system is not open source and it's not possible to integrate EBMS, TALIS EBMS will help you to send all invoices to OBR.
For more details, please read the readme.pdf file.
